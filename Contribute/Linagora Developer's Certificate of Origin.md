# Developer Certificate of Origin

[^Copyright (C) 2021 Linagora]: 



If you are reading this, then you're considering contributing to one or several LINAGORA project(s). That's great! We are enthusiastic about welcoming you as a LINAGORA project contributor, and working with you to make **#GoodTech4Good!** 

However, we have to ensure that anything you contribute to our projects:

•   is really your own creation, developed with your bare brain and fingers (or whatever organs you favor to type with your preferred input device), or that you’re allowed to contribute it;

•   is not “license locked”, i.e. that we can publish it under any other open source license in order to help our projects remain open source;

•   can remain in our projects and not suddenly become unusable because you change your mind and demand that we either use your code differently or not at all.

To achieve this, we first need you to agree to this Developer Certificate of Origin before we can accept merging your contributions to our projects. Once you've done so, you can create your pull requests right away!

By submitting a contribution to a LINAGORA project, you certify:

a)   that this contribution is provided under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode);

b)   being the rightful copyright owner of the contribution, and/or being fully and lawfully authorized to provide the contribution under the CC0 license on behalf of all entities which participated in the creation of the contribution (for example your employer);

c)   if the contribution is based upon a previous work, that this previous work is covered by an open source license which enables you to lawfully redistribute your contribution and this previous work both under the LINAGORA project license (Just reach out to us if you have any doubts, and we will help you);

d)  if your contribution is a derivative of one of our projects under a different license than the CC0 license, LINAGORA grants you a special authorization to provide this contribution to LINAGORA under the CC0 license regardless of the project license;

d)   if moral rights apply to your contribution, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that you will not try to assert your moral rights in a manner which would, directly or indirectly, interfere with the use of your contribution either by LINAGORA or by any project user (though, of course, you will always be credited as a contributor to the project);

e)   either that there are no patents applicable to your contribution, or if there are, that you then grant (and are allowed to lawfully grant) any users of your contribution a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free, transferable and irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the contribution in any form and any combination;

f)    understanding and acknowledging that the LINAGORA project, your contribution, and any record pertaining thereto are and might remain indefinitely public, and might also be re-distributed to third-parties under the terms of the LINAGORA project license and/or the CC0 license;

And that’s it! Let’s code now!
