# How to apply our license?

In order to distribute a program under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 with the additional terms for TWAKE software, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 

`<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does>`

`You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License and its applicable Additional Terms for TWAKE along with this program.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. 

If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a "Source" link that leads to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements. 

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
